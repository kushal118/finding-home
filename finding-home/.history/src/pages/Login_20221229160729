Hope all is well. I have applied for Residency Permit for a study extension to complete my master's thesis. According to their assessment, I have not studied full time but I have completed all courses in Autumn 2021 in time. I had only one course left in that semester Strategic management which I passed during the re-examination. Because of some technical fault, I have not graded for two questions but later when I asked for a review afterward I passed that course. Which means I have completed all my courses on time. Only my master's thesis was incomplete. Now I have started the Master's thesis. Please guide how can I appeal against the decision and prove that I am a full-time student . I have attached my conversation with our course coordinator and also the decision from Migrationsverket.
